TITLE : SIGNIFICANCE OF UNION AND INTERSECTION TYPES IN TYPESCRIPT

TypeScript serves as a superset of JavaScript, offering optional static type-checking along with the latest ECMAScript features. By incorporating types into your JavaScript code, TypeScript allows you to catch errors more effectively and write more maintainable and robust code, perfect for large-scale projects.

HOWEVER THERE ARE LOTS OF TYPES WE USE IN TYPESCRIPT . THE UNION AND INTERSECTION TYPES IN TYPESCRIPT ARE ONE OF THEM . WE CAN USE THOSE TYPES IN TYPESCRIPT TO HANDLE COMPLEX SITUATIONS IN AN EASY WAY 

1. UNION TYPES

Union types allow a variable to hold multiple types. When a variable has a union type, it can be any one of the specified types, which is particularly useful when a function or variable could reasonably take multiple forms. We can handle a complex situation easily using union types in TypeScript . here is one example of union types in TypeScript

//

  function student(id: string | number) {
  if (typeof id === "string") {
    console.log("ID as a string:", id.toUpperCase());
  } else {
    console.log("ID as a number:", id);
  }
}

here we can see that in function we can pass two types of parameter one the parameter will be string or number . in terms of handle multiple condition we can use union type very easily...   //

2. INTERSECTION TYPE 

In intersection types we can combine multiple types of data into one . an intersection type requires 2 or more object or variables to satisfy all types in intersection . here is some example of using intersection

//   interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface Student {
  studentId: number;
}

type Student1 = Person & Employee;

const studentDetails: Student1 = {
  name: "Mohammad Tanvir",
  age: 21,
  studentId: 1,
};    //

here we can see then intersection types are combined to object which is Person and Student and makes a new object . it helps us to handle multiple complex cases .
